Instructions to use this app-
1.this app was made using create-react-app
so to start the server use npm start (refer to package.json)
2.i used tailwind css to style in this project.
In case you are having any trouble while setting up tailwind then follow the instruction from tailwind css LINK=> https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides







NOTE-to handle state updates i might have used redux but in such small scale project it is perfectly fine to use redux according to my opinion.
