Instructions to use this app-
1.this app was made using create-react-app
so to start the server use npm start (refer to package.json)
2.i used tailwind css to style in this project.







NOTE-to handle state updates i might have used redux but in such small scale project it is perfectly fine to use redux according to my opinion.
